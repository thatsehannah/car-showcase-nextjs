This is a project I found on YouTube that I thought was pretty cool. I usually don't do YouTube projects, but I wanted a refresher on Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS together. So, I decided to stop being stubborn and see what YouTube had to offer. This is a car showcase app that is responsive and uses Rapid API to retrieve car data. I'll be updating the specs as I progress through the project.

Here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUNSHPyVryU

Project incorporates:
_ React Hooks
_ Headless UI
_ @apply directive used for attaching utility classes from TailwindCSS to class names in global CSS
_ Separation of reusuable components and section components
